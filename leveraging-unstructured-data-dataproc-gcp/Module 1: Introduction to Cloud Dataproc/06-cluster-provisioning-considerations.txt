So what's the problem with running everything on one cluster?

Think about it this way. What happens if you don't have enough computing power on that cluster for the number of jobs that you want to run?

Or conversely, what happens if you have way too much computing power for the active processes that you want to run?

And realize that the same cluster at some times may be too much and at other times it may be too little.

So what you really need to avoid over-provisioning a cluster or under-provisioning a cluster is to dynamically provision that cluster.
