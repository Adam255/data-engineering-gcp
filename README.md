# Google - Professional Data Engineer

A Professional Data Engineer enables data-driven decision making by collecting, transforming, and visualizing data. The Data Engineer designs, builds, maintains, and troubleshoots data processing systems with a particular emphasis on the security, reliability, fault-tolerance, scalability, fidelity, and efficiency of such systems.

The Data Engineer also analyzes data to gain insight into business outcomes, builds statistical models to support decision-making, and creates machine learning models to automate and simplify key business processes.

The Google Cloud Certified - Professional Data Engineer exam assesses your ability to:

- Build and maintain data structures and databases
- Design data processing systems
- Analyze data and enable machine learning
- Model business processes for analysis and optimization
- Design for reliability
- Visualize data and advocate policy
- Design for security and compliance

**This repository contains a collection of resources that will help you prepare.**

## Google Developers Codelabs
Provide a guided, tutorial, hands-on coding experience. Most codelabs will step you through the process of building a small application, or adding a new feature to an existing application. They cover a wide range of topics such as Android Wear, Google Compute Engine, Project Tango, and Google APIs on iOS.

### Labs and demos for courses for GCP Training
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst

### In this lab you spin up a virtual machine, configure its security, and access it remotely.
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cpb100-compute-engine/

### In this lab you carry out the steps of an ingest-transform-and-publish data pipeline manually.

### Geographic data in Datalab
This notebook demonstrates how to use Datalab to display the earthquakes that have happened over the past 7 days. The data come from USGS, and we will use the Python module basemap to do the plotting.
